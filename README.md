# ezmq library (c)

protocol-ezmq-c is wrapper library which is written on the top of [protocol-ezmq-cpp](https://github.com/edgexfoundry-holding/protocol-ezmq-cpp), that provides a standard messaging interface over various data streaming
and serialization / deserialization middlewares along with some added functionalities.</br>
  - Currently supports streaming using 0mq and serialization / deserialization using protobuf.
  - Publisher -> Multiple Subscribers broadcasting.
  - Topic based subscription and data routing at source (read publisher).
  - High speed serialization and deserialization.


## Prerequisites ##
 - You must install basic prerequisites for build
   - Install build-essential
   ```
   $ sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```

- Python
  - Version : 2.4 to 3.0
  - [How to install](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

- SCons
  - Version : 2.3.0 or above
  - [How to install](http://scons.org/doc/2.3.0/HTML/scons-user/c95.html)

## How to build ##
1. Goto: ~/protocol-ezmq-c/
2. Run the script:
   ```
   ./build.sh <options>
   ```
**Notes** </br>
(a) For getting help about script option: **$ ./build.sh --help** </br>
(b) Currently, Script needs sudo permission for building protocol-ezmq-cpp's dependencies [zeroMQ and protobuf]. In future need for sudo will be removed by installing those libraries in ezmq-protocol-cpp library.

## How to run ##

### Prerequisites ###
 Built c ezmq library.

### Subscriber sample ###
1. Goto: ~/protocol-ezmq-c/out/linux/{ARCH}/{MODE}/samples/
2. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../../../../dependencies/protocol-ezmq-cpp/out/linux/{ARCH}/{MODE}/
3. Run the sample:
    ```
     ./csubscriber
    ```
    - **It will give list of options for running the sample.** </br>
    - **Update ip, port and topic as per requirement.** </br>

### Publisher sample ###
1. Goto: ~/protocol-ezmq-c/out/linux/{ARCH}/{MODE}/samples/
2. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../../../../dependencies/protocol-ezmq-cpp/out/linux/{ARCH}/{MODE}/
3. Run the sample:
   ```
   ./cpublisher
   ```
   - **It will give list of options for running the sample.** </br>
   - **Update port and topic as per requirement.** </br>

## Usage guide for c ezmq library (for microservices)

1. The microservice which wants to use c ezmq APIs has to link following libraries:</br></br>
   **(A) If microservice wants to link c ezmq dynamically following are the libraries it needs to link:**</br>
        - ezmq.so</br>
        - cezmq.so </br>
   **(B) If microservice wants to link c ezmq statically following are the libraries it needs to link:**</br>
        - ezmq.a</br>
        - cezmq.a </br>
2. Reference c ezmq library APIs : [doc/doxygen/docs/html/index.html](doc/doxygen/docs/html/index.html)

## Future Work ##
  - High speed parallel ordered serialization / deserialization based on streaming load.
  - Threadpool for multi-subscriber handling.
  - Router pattern. For number of subscribers to single publisher use case.
  - Clustering Support.
